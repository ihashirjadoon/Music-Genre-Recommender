# Music Genre Recommender

This repository contains code to build a music genre recommender using a Decision Tree classifier. The dataset used is provided in an Excel file (`music.xlsx`), which includes features such as age and gender, along with the corresponding music genres.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

## Important Note: 

To view the .dot file generated by the Decision Tree classifier, you need to install an extension in Visual Studio Code. The extension is called Graphviz Interactive Preview. After installing, open the .dot file, then open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), search for "graphviz", and select "Graphviz: Preview".


```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
